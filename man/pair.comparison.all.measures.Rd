\title{Compare Methods Across Multiple Measures}
\usage{
pair.comparison.all.measures(
  names.csvs,
  FolderOrigin,
  FolderDestiny,
  names.methods,
  names.measures
)
}
\arguments{
\item{names.csvs}{A character vector of CSV filenames (not used in the 
function body).}

\item{FolderOrigin}{A character string specifying the path to the 
folder containing the original CSV files.}

\item{FolderDestiny}{A character string specifying the path to the 
folder where results will be saved.}

\item{names.methods}{A character vector of method names used as 
column names in the data.}

\item{names.measures}{A character vector of measure names to process.}
}
\value{
A list containing the comparison results for each measure:
\itemize{
  \item \code{results} - A list of lists, where each inner list contains:
    \item \code{greater_or_equal} - Data frame of datasets where methods are greater than or equal.
    \item \code{greater} - Data frame of datasets where methods are strictly greater.
    \item \code{less_or_equal} - Data frame of datasets where methods are less than or equal.
    \item \code{less} - Data frame of datasets where methods are strictly less.
    \item \code{equal} - Data frame of datasets where methods are equal.
}
}
\description{
This function compares methods across multiple measures by 
calculating various comparison metrics 
for each dataset. The results are saved as CSV files in specified folders and also returned as a list.
}
\examples{
# Assuming CSV files are available and directories are set correctly
results <- pair.comparison.all.measures(
  names.csvs = c("measure1", "measure2"),
  FolderOrigin = "data/origin",
  FolderDestiny = "data/destiny",
  names.methods = c("Method1", "Method2"),
  names.measures = c("Measure1", "Measure2")
)
