\title{Compare Methods for a Single CSV File}
\usage{
pair.comparison(
  filename,
  FolderOrigin,
  FolderDestiny,
  measure.name,
  names.methods
)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{A character string specifying the full path of the CSV file to process.}

\item{FolderOrigin}{A character string specifying the path to the folder containing the CSV file.}

\item{FolderDestiny}{A character string specifying the path to the folder where results will be saved.}

\item{measure.name}{A character string specifying the name of the measure being processed.}

\item{names.methods}{A character vector of method names used as column names in the data.}
}
\value{
A list containing the comparison results:
\itemize{
  \item \code{greater_or_equal} - Data frame of datasets where methods are greater than or equal.
  \item \code{greater} - Data frame of datasets where methods are strictly greater.
  \item \code{less_or_equal} - Data frame of datasets where methods are less than or equal.
  \item \code{less} - Data frame of datasets where methods are strictly less.
  \item \code{equal} - Data frame of datasets where methods are equal.
}
}
\description{
This function compares methods across a single CSV file by calculating
various comparison metrics for the provided dataset. The results are saved 
as CSV files in a specified folder and also returned as a list.
}
\examples{
# Assuming CSV files are available and directories are set correctly
results <- pair.comparison(
  filename = "data/accuracy.csv",
  FolderOrigin = "data",
  FolderDestiny = "results",
  measure.name = "accuracy",
  names.methods = c("Model_1", "Model_2", "Model_3", "Model_4")
)
