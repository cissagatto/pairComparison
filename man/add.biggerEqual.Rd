\title{Count Values Greater Than or Equal to a Threshold}
\usage{
add.biggerEqual(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector. The elements of this vector are 
compared to \code{y}.}

\item{y}{A numeric value. The threshold value against which the 
elements of \code{x} are compared.}
}
\value{
An integer value. The count of elements in \code{x} that 
are greater than or equal to \code{y}.
}
\description{
This function counts the number of elements in \code{x} that are greater 
than or equal to the 
value \code{y}. It compares each element of \code{x} with \code{y} and 
returns the count of those 
that meet the condition.
}
\examples{
add.biggerEqual(c(1, 2, 3, 4), 2)  # returns 3 (2, 3, 4 are >= 2)
add.biggerEqual(c(10, 5, 3), 6)   # returns 1 (10 is >= 6)
add.biggerEqual(c(1, 2, 3), 5)    # returns 0 (no elements are >= 5)
